1) In edit mode
	a) If one or more are checked, any changes I make to one are applied to all of them. (mainly for type)
	b) I can upload images by clicking on the image
		-) If I have multiple selected, and I upload multiple images, each image is applied to a different checked card.
		-) file name is automatically set
	c) All the fields have an "editable" LOOk to them, get rid of this white background on mouse over. They are all just styled with borders to look clickable/editable.

TODO:
1) Add option to set a thumbnail pic? Add a Game Settings page?
2) Clicking the "Card Manager" card should take me there.
3) Type is defaulting to spell/trap/monster, I need to be able to change that. 
4) Maybe "type" shouldn't be a default? Although essentially all games have types, so it does seem helpful.
	a) When I'm in edit mode, I should be able to edit the type columns with a modal window, like:
		-) Name, options, multiple at once?
5) Get rid of the white background on the type dropdown, make it dark like the rest of the theme.
6) When we mouse over a card image, in edit mode and normal mode, the card pops up zoomed in so we can the stats.
7) In edit mode, the custom attributes are outside the width of the table and aren't visible and so can't be edited.
8) We need to be able to move the columns around to get the important ones on the left
9) How to display big effect boxes? Maybe a "see more" button to temporarily expand the field?
